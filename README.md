# RedirectProject


- Just a simple project where i'll input my clients number and the website will redirect me all the way to his WhatsApp.

13.07 - I have done some style improvements and added new functions to the form, as like: 
<br>
1. Two new fields: one for the clients name and another to input the service specialty.
2. With these two informations, the application will auto fill a short scripted message to start the conversation with the client.

22.07 - Removed the mask of the nummber input area. Shoutout to @MychaelJales for commiting the unmask function.
